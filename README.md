## ABOUT
Implementation of a face detection algorithm running on STM32H7B3I-DISCOVERY. The image is captured with a camera using the DCMI interface, then it is processed and displayed on LCD display. The algorithm used for face detection is fully quantized SSD-Mobilenet. Different YOLOX nano versions (for face detection) can also be found in the /models directory.
